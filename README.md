# WebHID DS4 Web Component

Connect a PlayStation DS4 controller to your device and click on 'Connect' to interact with the virtual controller.
If you don't have a DS4 or would just like to see it in operation check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZfjJ_p9w6E).

Requires a browser with [WebHID support](https://caniuse.com/webhid).
USB only recommended for now due to poor performance and feature limitations on Bluetooth.

Implemented as a reusable [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) in Vanilla JS with zero dependencies based on original work [here](https://github.com/TheBITLINK/WebHID-DS4).
